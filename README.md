This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates an example of an index out of bounds error when accessing elements in a vector.  The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code that will panic. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code using safe access methods.  Understanding how to handle potential index out-of-bounds errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable Rust applications.
